Changelog:

- 0.6
  - The Plasmoid now finally docks in the panel using Plasma.PopupApplet.
  - New icon! (cut'n'paste from other icons - hmmm).
  - Only import required parts of the used modules. The functionalities such
    as System Notifications and Network monitoring are now separate classes
    which makes them reusable in my other Plasmoids.
  - Fail gracefully on wrong KDE SC version.
  - Fix for not detecting network on some distributions.
  - Current/last conversion result is now shown in the tool tip when docked in the panel.
  - Removed collapse/expand because it didn't work properly and current result can be seen in tooltip.
  - Added context menu for updating current conversion.
  - Added configuration for refresh/update interval.
  - Improved KIO handling.
  - Notification on network errors.
  - Much improved error handling when no network connection using Solid. The Plasmoid
    is now disabled until a connection is established instead of just giving up and dying ;-)
  - Now using the KDE Currency classes (Only works from KDE SC 4.4.4).
  - Showing Currency name first instead of currency code to make the easier to find in the list.

- 0.5

    just want to monitor the exchange rate between two fixed currencies.

- 0.2
  - Fixed problem where ComboBox dropdowns were below other widgets.
  - Code refactoring and cleanup.
