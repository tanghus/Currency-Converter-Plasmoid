Currency Converter

Convert currencies using data from Yahoo! Financial.

A simple Plasmoid created using PyQt and PyKDE4.

Features:

 - Select to and/or from the dropdown list and the converted amount will be updated.

 - Change the amount to be converted and TAB or click outside the Amount field
   and the result will be updated.

 - Selected currencies and amount is saved between sessions.

 - Refreshing selected convertion when no activity for a user defined period of time.

 - Current/last conversion result is shown in the tool tip when docked in the panel.

Dependencies:

  Because I have only tried the Plasmoid on my own computer you may be able to use earlier versions.
  Currency Converter needs at least KDE SC 4.5.

  * python-kde4 v. 4.5.4
  * python-qt4 v. 4.7.3
  * plasma-scriptengine-python

  Install the Plasmoid:

  plasmapkg -i ./currency-converter.plasmoid

  Or update it:

  plasmapkg -o ./currency-converter.plasmoid

  Or add it from "Add Widgets"=>"Install New Widgets"=>"Download New Plasma Widgets"

Known Issues:

  The number of items in the currency dropdowns are set to a hardcoded limit if
  the Plasmoid is docked in the bottom panel:
