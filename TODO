TODO:

 - Translations. Currently only Danish translations.

 - Check version upgrade process: Is the config persistent?

 - Credits label link doesn't launch web site.

 - Dates aren't localized.

 - Send notifications instead of showMessage.

 - Better error detection on web service query.

 - Create a Currency Converter Data Engine.

 - Connect/emit settingsChanged in Settings.

 - Show the most used currencies at top of list.

IDEAS (comments are welcome):

 - Monitor currencies and notify on (...)

 - Offer other services than Yahoo! Finance.


KNOWN ISSUES:

 - In some installations Solid mistakenly reports no network connection.
   (For now this is fixed with a hack that interprets Status.Unknown as being connected)
